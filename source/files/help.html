		DicomImageIndexer is a stand-alone program for indexing a collection
		of DICOM image files, creating a searchable index allowing the images 
		to be found by:
		<ul>
		<li>File name
		<li>Transfer Syntax UID
		<li>Photometric Interpretation
		<li>Planar Configuration
		<li>Pixel Representation
		<li>Pixel Presentation
		<li>Modality
		</ul>

		<p>On a Windows machine, you can run the program by double-clicking it or by
		launching a command window, navigating to the DicomImageIndexer directory,
		and typing: 
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>java -jar DicomImageIndexer.jar</tt>
		
		<p>If an out-of-memory error occurs, you may assign more memory to
		the program by running it in a command window with the command:
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>java -Xmx768m -jar DicomImageIndexer.jar</tt>
		
		<p><b>The Index Tab</b>
		
		<p>When the program starts, it looks to see if it has a database. If it does not,
		it creates the database and populates it by walking the directory tree under the
		directory specified on the Properties tab. It parses all the files it finds in that
		tree and creates database entries for all the files that parse as DICOM objects.
		
		<p>The files in the tree can be re-indexed (for example, after  changing the directory
		specified on the Properties tab) by clicking the <b>Rebuild Index</b> button in the footer.
		
		<p>When the index is ready, the Index tab displays a summary of all the unique types
		of images it found.

		<p>Example images from all the image types can be exported to the DICOM Storage SCP
		whose URL is specified on the Properties tab by clicking the <b>Export All Types</b> button
		in the footer. The number of example images to export can be specified in the text field 
		to the left of the button.
		
		<p>All the images of a specific type can be exported by clicking the <b>Export</b> button
		next to the listing of the type.
		
		<p>All  the images of a specific type can be listed in the Results tab by clicking the <b>List</b> button
		next to the listing of the type.
		
		<p><b>The Search Tab</b>
		
		<p>The Search tab contains a list of all the query fields. The format of the query field
		imposes these rules:
		
		<ul>
		<li> Searches are case-sensitive.
		<li> A blank field matches a missing element or an element with an empty value.
		<li> <tt><b>*</b></tt> matches an element, whether it exists or not.
		<li> <tt><b>*text</b></tt> matches an element value that ends with <tt><b>text</b></tt>.
		<li> <tt><b>text*</b></tt> matches an element value that starts with <tt><b>text</b></tt>.
		<li> <tt><b>*text*</b></tt> matches an element value that contains <tt><b>text</b></tt>.
		<li> <tt><b>text</b></tt> matches an element value that exactly equals <tt><b>text</b></tt>.
		</ul>

		<p>When the <b>Search</b> button is clicked, the database is searched for images that
		match all the query fields, and the Results tab is automatically selected.
		
		<p><b>The Results Tab</b>
		
		<p>The Results tab lists the results of a query. Each matching file is listed,
		along with two buttons:
		
		<ul> 
		<li> The <b>Export</b> button exports the file to the DICOM Storage SCP 
		specified on the Properties tab. 
		<li> The <b>Binary</b> button launches the BinaryDump program and displays
		the contents of the file in binary form. For DICOM files, the BinaryDump
		program contains a DICOM parser that displays the binary in colors making
		it easy to follow the structure. It also contains a menu of functions that 
		show the contents of the file in parsed form. The <b>List Elements</b> menu item
		can be especially useful because it displays an attached frame that lists
		all the elements that the parser can parse. Clicking on any element automatically
		jumps the binary display to the selected element.
		</ul>
		
		<p><b>The Properties Tab</b>
		
		<p>The Properties tab allows for configuring the image root directory and the 
		DICOM Storage SCP URL.
		
		<p>The location of the BinaryDump program can also be configured, but it can
		be left blank.
